			<h3>Self Initiated Project: Food Waste</h3>
			<p>Through my research into the things we waste, I discovered that of all the food we buy, 25% of it is wasted. A quarter of everything - that's just too much. Some of it is waste that we prefer not to eat (potato skins for example) and the rest is food that we waste due to large portions and out of date food.</p>

			<p>To highlight this problem, I created sticky dashed-line tape to visually respresent the amount of that particular food is wasted and a QR code label. This QR code, when scanned with your smart phone links to lovefoodhatewaste.com</p>
