    <p>I'm Jack, and I'm incredibly pleased that you're taking a minute or two out of your day to read some things on my site. I am a creative front-end developer who loves the challenge of turning ideas into a web-based realities. With a strong background in design user experience, I take pride in building engaging digital experiences with a keen eye for detail.</p>
    <p>In the time spent away from my computer, I enjoy music, poetry, black coffee, straight whiskey (in moderation of course...) and good conversations with good people. I'm as passionate about building my own side projects as I am client work, so if you would like to collaborate with me on either, please do <a href="mailto:jack.underhill@hotmail.co.uk">get in touch</a>.</p>
    <p>Currently working as a freelance front end developer in London, I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and projects that I can jump into.</p>
