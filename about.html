      <p>Me: I enjoy creativity, cups of tea, being around good people, live music and getting back to pencil and paper when I can. I don't enjoy most of what's on television. I just finished Kingstosn University with a BA (Hons) in Graphic Design.</p>

      <p>My Work: I enjoy all areas of design, from web to moving image. I can appreciated a beautiful print, although I lean more towards digital - I'm what you'd call a 'techie' guy. That being said though, I can't do anything without writing or sketching it first. My notebook goes everywhere with me.</p>
