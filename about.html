    <p>I'm Jack, and I'm incredibly pleased that you're taking a minute or two out of your day to read some things on my site. I am a front-end developer and designer who loves the challenge of turning an ideas into a web-based realities. I like good people, black coffee and straight whisky (the latter in moderation of course...).</p>
    <p>I earned my Bachelors in Graphics Design at Kingston University. While studying, out of sheer student poverty, I taught myself to code an online portfolio as all the properly flexible CMS-driven portfolio sites had a fee attached. I found that I loved this new way of problem-solving, simultaneously indulging my visually creative side and my tech-nerd tendencies.</p>
    <p>Currently working as web designer/developer not far from London, I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and projects that I can jump into.</p>
