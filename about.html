			<p>Me: I enjoy creativity, endless cups of tea, being around good people, live music and occsionally the good old fashioned pen and paper. I do not enjoy most of what's on television, rude people and meringue. I just finished my second year BA (Hons) Graphic Design at Kingston Unviersity.</p>

			<p>My Work: I'll throw myself into anything if I think I'll enjoy it or if I don't quite know that yet. I'm what you'd call a 'techie' guy. That being said though, I can't do anything without writing/sketching it first. My notebook goes everywhere with me.</p>
