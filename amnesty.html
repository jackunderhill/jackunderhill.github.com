			<h3>Amnesty Fundraising: End Forced Evictions</h3>
			<p>We took a day in London to raise funds around awareness for Amnesty International and it's campaign to end forced evictions. The idea was go around London, actually wearing our sleeping bags, highlighting the issue of people being forced ouf of their beds in the middle of the night. Although less so in this country, it's an issue all over the world.</p>

			<p>However... as it turns out, people are very sceptical towards Amnesty International and issues that don't affect the UK more than anywhere else. Our task was to document our experiences regardless of success, so we created this honest short film, summing up what we learnt.</p>
