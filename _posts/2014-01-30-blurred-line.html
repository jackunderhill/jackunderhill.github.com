<p>I was told way back when I studied Philosophy in college that to be a philosopher you have to be everything; a mathematician, a physicist, a writer etc. Lately I've been thinking it should much the same for web designers and developers. Now, I'm not saying every one of us needs to be some extreme, Leonardo Da Vinci type polymath, but the more you know about the whole process, the more effective you become. I've been told numerous times by numerous people to do on one thing and do it well, to avoid being a 'Jack of all trades', but to work on an isolated part of the process would be a mistake. Designers and developers working together should have as deep an understand of each others' processes as is possible.</p>

<p>It benefits the developer who has to build something from the the designer's visuals if he understands the easiest way to do things when it comes to the code and doesn't design needless complex functionality. And if a developer has a design idea, they should bring that to the table with confidence, even though it's not <em>their area</em>.</p>

<p>My point is, when we call ourselves front-end developers, digital designers, creative technologists, whatever it may be - we must not forget that to create a truly effective product, you can't limit yourself to the job title that sits in your email signature.</p>
