<p>I often see people showing their day-to-day list of apps and devices and I find that quite interesting, so I thought I'd give it a go. I'm constantly on the look out for better ways of doing things though so if you know of a better app/method/machine then do <a href="mailto:jack.underhill@hotmail.co.uk">drop me a line.</a></p>
<h2>27" iMac</h2>
<p>I've had my iMac for a few years now and it's still going very strong - no noticeable slow down yet. At first the big screen was almost too big but it's amazing how quickly you get used to it. For me, being able to display large windows side-by-side is a big help to the workflow. <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/imac/">Link</a></p>
<h2>Sublime</h2>
<p>I've been noticing it's use more and more lately and it's clear why - it's a fantastic piece of software. With it's minimal good looks, infinitely configurable settings and loads of packages to extend it's functionality, it's what I'll happily spend hours and hours staring into. <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Link</a></p>
<h2>Photoshop</h2>
<p>What is there to say that hasn't been said already? I use it because it's the go-to software of the design industry, it's an incredibly feature-rich bit of kit. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html">Link</a></p>
<h2>SourceTree</h2>
<p>Not quite as simple a UI as the app from GitHub but SourceTree allows me to manage repositories from both GitHub and BitBucket, as well as adding a little more functionality here and there. <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">Link</a></p>
<h2>Google Docs</h2>
<p>I recently started using the cloud for quick spreadsheets and documents and now using an offline office suite seems so archaic! The ability to quickly share/collaborate is the major selling point. <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Link</a></p>
<h2>Google Chrome</h2>
<p>Of course. <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Link</a></p>
<h2>Flux</h2>
<p>Flux is really one of those things that initially, you think is needless, then after a while you wonder how you lived without it. It essentially sits there waiting for sunset and dims the colour of your display accordingly. At first you think it's too yellowy but it's amazing how quickly you realise that harsh default bluey light just isn't good for night time viewing. Apparently it helps you sleep better, as well as making those late night work sessions easier on the eyes. <a href="https://justgetflux.com/">Link</a></p>
<h2>MenuMeters</h2>
<p>Another little one that you forget is running in the background, MenuMeters displays little monitoring graphs and numbers in your taskbar to let you know all manner of things - from CPU temperature to network usage. Call me a control freak but I just like to know what's going on at a glance. <a href="https://justgetflux.com/">Link</a></p>
