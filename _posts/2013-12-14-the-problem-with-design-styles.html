title: The Problem with Design 'Styles'

---

<p>As a designer, I'm quite frequently told what's <i>in right now,</i> what's <i>stylish,</i> and this [product] was definitely created by [designer]. On the one hand, this is understandable - everything that has been designed (so... everything?) will be at some level effected by the surrounding visual material of that culture, at that point in history. But shouldn't we be aiming for timeless? Aiming for form to follow function so perfectly that no designer has a style? Designers aren't artists.</p>

<p>There are certain foundations of code that are fundamental and constant - keeping your work as simple as possible, as maintainable as possible, as light as possible etc, and I believe there should be more of this attitude towards design. We were taught the foundations of form and design at University of course, but there's too much on top. Too much making something look like something else. A 'style' can only answer a brief until it's no longer on trend.</p>

<p>Every now and then I see a wristwatch, or a table lamp or logo and I think that it looks designed in a way that was completely unconcerned with what's 'in right now'. These things are sometimes created a few years ago, sometimes a hundred years ago - surely is what every respectable designer is aiming for. I want there to be a day soon when digital design reaches this stage, where the user experience is all that matters, when a ten year old website looks like it could have been created yesterday. Every now and then I think it pays to remind yourself be less concerned with what visual style is currently fashionable, and focus on making something that is unique, timeless and devoid of anything superfluous.</p>
