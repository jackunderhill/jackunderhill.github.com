<p>It has of course, been a very long time since I last wrote a post. But since I started contracting and have some more time to work on my own projects, I thought I'd use it as a tool to document them.</p>
<p>The first of these is <a href="https://github.com/Charicode/charicode">Charicode (charity+code)</a>. I've set it up as an organisation on github so it can be hosted for free, and of course open sourced in the hope it might attract some contributers. There's still lots to do before it's at a useable state, so I'll post an update when it's ready.</p>
