<p>Although I’m a creative, I consider myself quite a ‘techie’ one. I love tinkering with things or having the satisfaction of knowing I coded my website from scratch. So I’m gonna order one these bad boys soon so I can make something cool with it once my portfolio is all done and dusted. I’m shamefully excited about it.</p>
