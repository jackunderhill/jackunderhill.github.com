<p>Recently had the pleasure of meeting up with the poet Shihan when he was in London a few weeks ago - he was kind enough to give me an insight into life as a poet, for a project I’m doing. Also the show he was in was so good (if you want something to do on a Thursday night, Bang Said the Gun at the Roebuck is a fantastic was to spend it). Really nice guy, if you’ve never heard/seen his work, search him on youtube.</p>
