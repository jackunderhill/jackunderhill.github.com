			<h3>The Poster Is Dead! Long Live The Poster!</h3>
			<p>A collaboration between Kingston and Westerdals students from Oslo, our task was to pay homage to the poster by creating an exhibition piece that also promotes the exhibition it will be featured in. It's well worth noting that the students from Oslo were really good to work with. It would have been good if they could have stayed for longer than the week.</p>

			<p>Our piece is made of layers of different posters, designed using various design styles throughout history, displaying all the information needed. As each square had adhesive on the back, new hybrid posters could be formed by everyone at the exhibition by rearranging the squares in new ways.</p>
