			<h3>Weather</h3>
			<p>For the 'Weather' brief, when thinking that it is a well known British stereotype that we always talk about the weather, I decided I would help us out. I created a small pack of cards, each with a short question to replace the boring 'so.. this weather we're having...'. They provoke enlightening responses and help you find out much more about a person.</p>
